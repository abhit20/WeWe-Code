# WeWeCode

Personal projects can be tough to think of and difficult to embark on. We wanted to leverage the power of peer programming that VS Code's live share offers along with the sense of community opensource platforms provide. 

WeWe Code extension allows users to easily post their project Live Share link with descriptions onto the WeWe Code site. They can also cap the amount of peers they are looking for. Peers looking to join projects can scroll through WeWe Code web interface to find a project of their liking.
